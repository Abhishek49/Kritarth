				<p>We, being the first medical society of KSAC have taken an initiative to break the common norms about behavioural disorders that cloud people's mind. Come join us as we unfurl the mysteries of the ' not-so - complicated' human mind and bust all the myths that the society has regarding these medical conditions, in a way like never before. What do you think about the human mind? About its mysteries? Bring out your empathizing human and show us what you have in mind about all that affects human behaviour and your best way of management of such a socially avoidably unavoidable phenomenon. Step in for a role play on a vast range of mental ailments that affect the human brain in this exciting workshop on 25th September 2016.</p>
